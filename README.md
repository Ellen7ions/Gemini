# Gemini

![Gemini](doc/gemini.jpg)

Gemini is prominent in the winter skies of the northern Hemisphere and is visible the entire night in Decemberâ€“January.

If you find Castor and Pollux, you find me.

### [Problems]

I find the timing is still failed thougth I remove the cp0, hilo, exceptions and load-store from p datapath.

The critical datapath exists the path from npc to mmu and tlb, maybe I should add a register between npc and mmu.

### [Milestone]

#### 6-25

Add TLB MMU, Pass Lab14. The original Lab14 has only 5 test points, you have to compile it with exceptions testing yourself.

**Linux, where r u ?**

#### 6-22

Optimize Timing, **100mhz** again ~, but it's ubstable...

#### 6-20

Finished exceptions and interruption. it can run at **90mhz** !

#### 6-14

I can't believe it can run at **100mhz** !
